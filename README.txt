### IMPORTANT ###
Game should reset once you beat Battle 3 allowing you to play through the game again, however to ensure no loss of progress plan one sitting to beat the entire game.

Losing a battle returns you to the level select for you to try the battle again.

If you walk too far past the battle podiums, you may need to walk back and then collide again with it to get the trigger to interact

-GAME BREAKING BUGS-
No known game breaking bugs, the game should run as intended.
Audio is a little out of sync for the player for whatever reason, we weren't able to fix this but it should be a minor issue.
